                <p> One of my earliest memories was spending time with a newly born Subin, So in a way,we grew up
                    together.
                    Therefore, from going to the store at the end of the road to eating together, we did everything
                    together.
                </p>

                <p>Subin was somehow not bothered by vaccum cleaners. Even though the loudness of it was able to scare
                    any
                    animals away, Subin enjoyed the chaos of it, opting to even sit on the handle as we vaccum.

                <img class="main_img" src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower." />

                <p> Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human)
                    and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a
                    seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping
                </p>

                <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking
                    like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as
                    his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being
                    middle-aged.

                <h1>Milktea</h1>
                <img class="main_img" src="images/Main.JPG" alt="Milktea taking nap" />

                <p> Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to
                    eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by
                    complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would
                    be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see
                    the manager.”

                </p>

                <p>Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought
                    upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain
                    when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and
                    it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding
                    animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health.

                <p> Leo is a very hyper labradoodle who enjoys running around and meeting new people. Leo recently
                    turned six back in July, and received two toys for his birthday which he has already destroyed. Leo
                    also enjoys laying around the house, his favorite spots being my parents bedroom and the living room
                    couch.
                </p>

                <p>Leo is a big fan of when the mailman comes because that means he will get a treat. At bedtime, Leo
                    waits for both of my parents to get into bed before he goes to bed. He thinks he needs to guard them
                    while they are both still awake.

                    alt="A black and white kitten sitting down and wearing a yellow collar." />

                <p> Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to
                    Marquette, Michigan. He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me
                    and after some healthy meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!
                </p>

                <p>My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large
                    house since we were previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to
                    run around, but when he is sleepy he is happy to be held.

                <p> York loves to stay active and go on long walks by his house. He also enjoys chewing on his large
                    assortment of toys. His favorite toy is his squeaky pig. York’s favorite food is sausage, but cheese
                    is another favorite.
                </p>

                <p> York is a very sociable dog and is a licensed therapy dog. He frequently visits nursing homes and
                    other places in an attempt to raise peoples’ spirits. When it comes to bedtime, York prefers to
                    sleep alone in his favorite blue dog bed. He will always be the first to get up in the morning.

                <p> Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun
                    on his side and lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw
                    them, but eventually, he gets bored and just stops fetching them and lays down.
                </p>

                <p> Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn’t like water (showers and even rain) or getting his
                    nails clipped, and he’s sometimes even so lazy that he’ll just stop walking and sit down until you
                    turn around and go back home.
