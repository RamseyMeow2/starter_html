                    steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River over millions of years. The canyon is known for its
                    size, vibrant and varied colors, and intricate rock formations. It is one of the most famous and
                    visited natural landmarks in the United States and around the world.

                    is very famous also for its railway created in 1912 that can bring you to a height of 3454m. At the
                    summit there are outstanding views where you can see the whole city and beyond.
                </p>
                <p> The scenery consists of valleys, waterfalls, rock walls, and snow peaks. When visiting, it is vital
                    to go on a day with good weather because it enhances the quality of the views. Hiking is very
                    popular at short trails called Grutschalp and Murren. A very common tourist attraction is also
                    exploring the Lauterbrunnen valley.
